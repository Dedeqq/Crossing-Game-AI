# Crossing-Game-AI
This is my first reinforcement learning project. Firstly, I have created a game. The goal of the player (red square) is to get to the right side of the screen while avoiding green moving walls. Run cross_game_human.py if u want to play it. Then I have build a neural network and trained it to play the game. During the training agent learns to play the game. Run agent.py to see this process.
